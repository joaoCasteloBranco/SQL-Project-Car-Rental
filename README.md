# SQL-Project-Car-Rental
The project will build a database responsible for managing data for a company in the vehicle rental industry. The database will be able to store data on customers, employees and existing positions, as well as models, brands, cars and information on rentals made by the company's customers.

## Important

The database **dbRentalcar.db** was used only for testing purposes and will not be included in the repository.

### Database Structure

The `.sql` files contain the necessary instructions to create and populate the database tables. To set up your own local database, you can execute the SQL scripts available in this repository.
